“I hide you from sight, I silence your breath,
I shield you from danger, even from Death.
I’m one of three, both old and sly —
Worn by the boy who lived not to die.”

🔑 Answer: Invisibility Cloak 


I show not your face, but your soul's desire,
A flickering flame, a longing fire.
Stand before me — no need to speak,
I reveal the thing you most seek.

🪞 Answer: Mirror of Erised 



I slither through walls and only speak
To those who know the tongue I seek.
A hidden path, a monster’s roar —
I opened once the chamber door.

🐍 Answer: Basilisk 



With ink and magic, I hide the truth,
Revealed by those who know my proof.
Four clever minds left me behind,
To aid the lost — if you're aligned.

🐾 Answer: Marauder’s Map 


I did not chase the crown of flame,
Yet through the trials, I played the game.
A badge of black, a heart of gold,
I walked the path both brave and bold.
A twist of fate, a final breath,
A trophy touched, a sudden death.
The shadow rose, the light withdrew—
Yet in my fall, I still was true.
Who am I?

🟨 Answer: Cedric Diggory 



I chase the stars, not what is seen,
I speak of things that hide between.
With radish earrings, wand in hand,
I walk where few would understand.

My mind is strange, but heart is true,
I see the world in deeper hue.
When others mock or turn away,
I stand with light and choose to stay.

Who am I?

🟦 Answer: Luna Lovegood


I speak in riddles, twinkle eyes,
Yet all I touch is bound by ties.
I planned the end before the start,
With heavy mind and heavy heart.
A phoenix flies where once I fell,
And secrets sleep I’ll never tell.
Who am I?

🟨 Answer: Dumbledore


I jest and joke with fearless flair,
In darkest times, I still was there.
With twin-born spark and rebel flame,
I fought the fight and played the game.
A final laugh, a hero’s end,
My name lives on through every friend.
Who am I?

🟨 Answer: Fred Weasley   




I burn to live, I die to rise,
A crimson flame beneath the skies.
In silent flight, I heed the brave,
I heal the wound, I guard the grave.

Where loyalty is pure and deep,
I come to those who hurt and weep.
A tear, a song — then gone once more,
Reborn in ash, forever lore.

Who am I?

🔥 Answer: Fawkes  


Yet roots run deep where none may see,
And strength grows quietly like a tree.

I held the line when all had fled,
I struck the snake, I raised the dead.

Not chosen once, but chosen still —
To stand with heart, to rise with will.

Who am I?

🌿 Answer: Neville Longbottom  



I walked the night, I bore a name
That dripped with dark ancestral shame.
Yet in the stars, I forged my path,
Away from blood and twisted wrath.

A prisoner once, in shadow cast,
A godfather with haunted past.

I burned the name that caged my soul,
I chose my own, I paid the toll.

Who am I?

🐾 Answer: Sirius Black  


I wore no crest, I bore no wand,
But served with love far, far beyond.
A humble gift, a piece of thread —
Yet for that sock, I leapt ahead.

I broke my chains to choose what's right,
I gave my all to save the light.
My voice was small, my heart stood tall —
A free elf answering the call.

Who am I?

🧦 Answer: Dobby

“You’ve wandered through stories, touched every frame,
Lit quiet halls with love — not fame.
Each portrait stirred, each soul replied —
In your steps, our magic sighed.

This magic stays because of you.
Not by wand... but by what you do.”

🪄 Thank you for keeping the magic alive.
✨ Mischief Managed. ✨
